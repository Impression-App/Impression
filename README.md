# Project3 - Impression

# About

COVID-19 has had a big impact on daily life. One aspect that was immediately affected by the virus was academics.
With the need of everything becoming virtual, students have been taking their education at home from their laptops and/or mobile devices.
All activities and events that students usually participated in were made virtual, as well, including career fairs and recruitment opportunities.
Due to this, recruiters and students struggle to find ways to make a virtual connection to be as successful as an in-person one;
it has become an arduous task for recruiters and applicants to exchange information. This is where our application, Impression, comes in.

By giving each user a unique QR code to scan, Impression will allow the user to make connections on the spot through their mobile devices.
These connections will add users to each other's contact list and store the users' personal information, like how to contact them, resume, links to personal websites, etc.
Companies will be able to attach any important documents about their mission statement, open positions, or any other information they want be made readily available.
Impression will allow for a seamless exhcange of information between users and will reduce the amount of paper often used during career fairs and/or interviews,
as all the information will be stored virtually for the users to revisit if need be.

# Disclaimer

- Because Heroku takes a while to start up on the first launch, when the application is first launched, it might take a while to actually respond

# Setup

NOTE: This was needed for me on ubuntu linux, proceed with caution. May delete these steps if not needed.

1. Run the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` to verify you have the latest versions of node and npm installed. If not updated, update with the commands `npm install -g npm`.
   NOTE: The app may not run without up to date `node` and `npm` versions. App is confirmed to run on `node v10.23.0` and `npm 6.14.8`
2. Add your PATH to your `~/.profile` with `echo "export PATH=$PATH:~/.npm-global/bin" >> ~/.profile`.
3. To avoid having to source `~/.profile` upon terminal startup, run the command `echo "source ~/.profile" >> ~/.bashrc`

# Installs Needed

1. Run `npm install` inside of the project directory. This will install all required packages in the project.
2. Run `[sudo] pip[3] install flask` inside of the project directory to install flask.
3. Run `[sudo] pip[3] install flask-socketio` inside of the project directory to install flask-socketio.
4. Run `[sudo] pip[3] install Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.1` inside of the project directory to install SQLAlchemy.
5. Run `python -m pip install requests` inside of the project directory to install Requests.

   NOTE: If errors occur try running `[sudo] pip[3] install psycopg2-binary` instead.
7. Run `[sudo] pip[3] install pyqrcode` inside of the project directory to install pyqrcode.
8. Run `[sudo] pip[3] install boto3` inside of the project directory to install boto3.
9. Run `sudo yum install postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-devel postgresql-contrib postgresql-docs` inside of the project directory to install PostGreSQL.

# Setup Expo

1. Install expo by running the command `npm install -g expo-cli`.

# View on Expo

1. On an android mobile device download and open the `Expo` app on the `Google Play Store`.
2. Back on your pc, open a terminal and change directories with `cd ~/Impression/Backend`.
3. Run the command `python server.py` to start the server.
4. In another terminal, change directories with `cd ~/Impression`.
5. Run the application `npm run start`.
6. A web browser should open up with the Metro Bundler. If not press `?` in the terminal to display a list of commands for help.
7. Select the `connection` setting `LAN`.
8. When the connection is complete, use the `Expo` app to scan the QR code that appears in the terminal or web page. The app should should now appear on your android devices screen.

# Linting

For linting, we decided to ignore these errors/warnings:

1. E1101 (no-member) for all python files that have to do with the SQLAlchemy instances
2. R0902 (too-many-instance-attributes) because we need that many instances for our project
3. R0903 (too-few-public-methods) because we just need these classes to store data
4. R0913 (too-many-arguments) because our table needs those specific arguments for the users information
5. R1710: (inconsistent-return-statements) because we need to return that specific statement there for upload
6. C0114 (missing-module-docstring)/C0115 (missing-class-docstring)/C0116 (missing-function-docstring) because
   we do not have docstrings for our modules/classes/functions
7. C0413 (wrong-import-position) because we need the import statements after the 'db.session.commit()' in server.py
8. W0611 (unused-import) because we need the imports for SQL Alchemy in those separate python files
